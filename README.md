# Portfolio :computer:

This project is developed by Kia Sambrook to display and dynamically update her personal portfolio. To see the current website visit [here](www.kiasambrook.co.uk).
The portfolio is made up of HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, and currently uses a MySQL database. 

The site is split into two sections with the first being the public site, and second is the admin area to allow Kia to access the project details and add more projects, work experience, and education to the public portfolio. 

Thanks for checking out the project! ðŸ˜„
